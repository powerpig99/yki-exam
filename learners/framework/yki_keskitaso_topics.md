## 13. Key Preparation Strategies

### Speaking
- Practice thinking in Finnish, not translating
- For kertominen: tell stories fluently, don't stop mid-sentence
- For mielipide: structure as "mun mielestä... toisaalta... mutta..."
- Speak MORE rather than less — silence is worse than imperfect speech
- Practice phone conversation format (can't see the other person)
- **Fill the entire 2 minutes for mielipide opinion** — keep talking even if you run out of prepared points; add examples, rephrase, or address counterarguments
- Listening is reported as the hardest section by most test-takers — it uses natural speech speed with slang and colloquial forms
- **"Cascade failure" prevention:** If you miss a question in listening, immediately pivot to the next — don't dwell
- **Sound quality gap:** Test recordings use "sloppy" natural speech with elided vowels and regional accents — practice with podcasts and radio, not just textbook audio
- **Kielistudio chaos:** 20+ candidates speak simultaneously — practice speaking with background noise (e.g., radio playing) to simulate

### Writing
- Write as much as possible — too much is better than too little
- Know the difference between informal (mä, mun, sun) and formal (minä, hyvä virkailija)
- Practice: viesti (informal), valitus/kirje (formal), mielipide (opinion)
- Structure opinion pieces: position -> argument -> example -> conclusion
- Don't aim for perfection — clarity beats grammar
- Half a page for mielipide can still get level 3 (per test-taker reports)
- **Always provide 3 supporting arguments** for any opinion task — this is the expected structure

### Listening
- Listen to YLE news, podcasts, Finnish radio
- Practice with natural speed Finnish (not textbook audio)
- Focus on main ideas, not every word
- YLE YKItreenit provides good practice material

### Reading
- Read Finnish news articles, ads, instructions
- Practice scanning for specific information
- Build vocabulary around all 7 themes
- **Don't get stuck on one text** — keep a pace of ~10 minutes per text and move on

### Strategic Insights
- **Topics repeat across test cycles** — according to yki-testi.fi, ~90% of topics recur from previous tests. Studying past topics (Section 8) gives strong coverage
- **Empty answers get MINUS points; wrong answers do NOT** — always write or say something, even if uncertain
- **Listening tip:** First listen for overall meaning; second listen for specific answers. Don't panic if you miss something on first play
- **Reading tip:** Read questions FIRST, then scan text for answers — saves time
- **Writing tip:** For Task 2 (formal), address EVERY point mentioned in the task instructions — missing a required point costs more than grammatical errors

## 17. Update Protocol (for --update-research)

### Monthly (high volatility)

- OPH registration page: fee/policy details
- OPH after-test page: mailing status, reassessment rules

### Quarterly (medium volatility)
- Migri language-skill pages: citizenship language-proof rules, fee changes
- Reddit r/LearnFinnish + Finland Forum + blog scan for newly reported test topics
- Price table spot-check: HSL, healthcare fees, Migri fees

### Yearly (low volatility)
- OPH framework/specification documents and assessment criteria PDFs
- Major structure/policy changes (OPH news announcements)
- Resource link validation (check for dead URLs)

### Data Hygiene Rules
- Keep "Official" (OPH/Migri/JYU) and "Observed" (test-taker reports) sources distinguishable
- Do not promote observed-only topics to official status without primary-source confirmation
- For content generation, prioritize topics appearing in 2+ observed sources OR 1 observed + official-theme match
- When updating prices, always note the source and date verified
